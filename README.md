Inventory Management System for College Stationery Products (Flutter App)
Project Overview
This project is an Inventory Management System built as a Flutter mobile app to manage requisitions of stationery products by faculty members at a college. Faculties can request stationery items (like pens, notebooks, and other office supplies) through a requisition form. The app interacts with Firebase for real-time data storage, authentication, and notifications.

Admins can manage inventory, approve or reject faculty requisitions, and track stock levels directly through the app.

Features
Faculty Requisition Form: Faculty members can fill out a form to request stationary items (e.g., pens, notebooks, markers).
Inventory Management: Admins can manage inventory (add, update, or remove items).
Request Approval: Admins can approve or reject requisition requests based on available stock.
Real-Time Database: Firebase Firestore is used for real-time updates of the requisition requests and inventory.
Authentication: Firebase Authentication allows faculty members and admins to log in securely.
Push Notifications: Faculty members receive notifications about the status of their requisitions (approved/rejected).
Admin Dashboard: Admins can view all requisitions, current inventory, and generate reports for stock management.
Technologies Used
Flutter: For building a cross-platform mobile application for both iOS and Android.
Firebase:
Firebase Authentication for secure login and user management.
Firebase Firestore for real-time database to store requisitions, products, and inventory details.
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications.
Provider: State management for the app (optional).
Flutter Local Notifications: For in-app notifications.
System Requirements
Flutter SDK: To build the mobile application.
Android Studio or Visual Studio Code: For code editing and app development.
Firebase Project: Set up a Firebase project for authentication, Firestore, and notifications.
Device or Emulator: An Android or iOS device or emulator to run the app.
Installation Guide
Prerequisites
Install Flutter SDK:

Download and install the Flutter SDK from the official website: Flutter Installation Guide.
Install Android Studio or Visual Studio Code for development and running the app.

Set up a Firebase Project:

Create a Firebase project on the Firebase Console.
Enable Firebase Authentication and set up Firestore Database.
Add your Android and/or iOS app to the Firebase project.

Configure Firebase
In the Firebase Console, navigate to your project.
Add your Android and iOS app to Firebase:
For Android: Download the google-services.json file and place it in the android/app directory.
For iOS: Download the GoogleService-Info.plist file and place it in the ios/Runner directory.
Ensure Firebase Authentication is enabled for email/password login.
Set up Firestore with the following collections:
inventory: Contains information about available stationery products (name, quantity, price, etc.).
requisitions: Stores requisition requests from faculties (requested items, quantities, status).
users: Stores user information (faculty/admin).



Firebase Firestore Structure
Hereâ€™s an example of how your Firestore database might be structured:

Users Collection

Document: user_id
name: "John Doe"
role: "faculty" (or "admin")
email: "johndoe@example.com"
requisitions: [list of requisition document IDs]
Inventory Collection

Document: product_id
name: "Pen"
quantity: 100
price: 1.5
Requisitions Collection

Document: requisition_id
faculty_id: "user_id"
product: "Pen"
quantity: 5
status: "pending" (or "approved"/"rejected")
Usage
Faculty Features
